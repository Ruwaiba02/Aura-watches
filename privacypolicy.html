            III. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
            <br>
            We use different methods to collect information from and about you including through:
            <br><br>
            DIRECT INTERACTIONS. You may give us your Identity, Demographic, Contact, Financial, Profile, or Marketing and Communications Information by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by mail, phone, email, or otherwise. This includes Personal Information you provide when you:
            purchase our products or services;
            create an account on our Websites;
            subscribe to emails or newsletters;
            request services or other information;
            enter a competition, promotion or survey; or
            give us feedback about products, services, or the Websites.
            <br><br>
            AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES OR INTERACTIONS. As you navigate through the Websites, we may automatically collect Technical, Usage, and Location Information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Information by using cookies, pixel tags, embedded scripts and other similar technologies. [We may also receive Technical Information about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies.]
            <br><br>
            COOKIES - Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your Device while you are viewing the website that are stored on the Device. Cookies can be used for many purposes, including to monitor use of websites, to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to speed up your searches and purchases and to recognize you when you return to our Websites and/or store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Websites. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Websites or our content may not function properly.
            <br><br>
            PIXEL TAG – Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear GIFs, 1x1 GIFs Web beacons, or Web bugs) are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included on the Websites and in our e-mail messages. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s Device, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a pixel tag. Pixel Tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
            <br><br>
            EMBEDDED SCRIPTS - Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites, such as the links you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the Websites.
            <br><br>
            FLASH LSOS – When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “flash cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, please visit: HTTP://WWW.MACROMEDIA.COM/SUPPORT/DOCUMENTATION/EN/FLASHPLAYER/HELP/SETTINGS_MANAGER07.HTML.
            <br><br>
            COMMUNITY FEATURES. The Websites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post User Content publicly through reviews, surveys, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Community Features”). We may provide functionality for you to submit or post User Content through Community Features, by linking the Websites to a third party service, or otherwise. Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Websites along with your User Content. User Content consisting of uploaded files may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information or other information about or relating to you. You may wish to remove metadata from your files before transmitting such files to WATCHES.COM. NOTE THAT ANYTHING YOU POST THROUGH COMMUNITY FEATURES IS PUBLIC – OTHERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR USER CONTENT AND MAY USE IT OR SHARE IT WITH THIRD PARTIES. IF YOU CHOOSE TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION, THAT INFORMATION WILL BE CONSIDERED PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THE PROTECTIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY WILL NOT APPLY. IF YOU SUBMIT USER CONTENT, IT MAY BE PUBLISHED ONLINE OR OFFLINE AT ANY TIME. IN ADDITION, WE MAY USE YOUR USER CONTENT AND ANY EXCERPT FROM YOUR USER CONTENT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADVERTISING, MARKETING, PUBLICITY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.
            <br><br>
            THIRD PARTIES OR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES. We may receive Personal Information about you from various third parties.
